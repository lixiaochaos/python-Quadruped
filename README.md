# Python-Quadruped
A project to create working python code for a Quadruped with a Raspberry Pi Zero or Zero W as the control board.

The aim is to use a Raspberry Pi Zero (or Zero W), a pwm expansion board and a forward facing distance sensor to program a Quadruped for autonomous movement. The movement will follow the right-hand rule to navigate an entire room (or space), acomplish object avoidance (in the forward facing space), and the intention is to eventually use this data to create a basic text map of a space.
